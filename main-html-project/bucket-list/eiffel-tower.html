        The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the in Paris,
        France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose 
        company designed and built the tower. It was constructed from 1887
        to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair. Although 
        initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and 
        intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural
        icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the 
        world. The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an 
        entrance fee in the world: 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015.
        The tower is 330 meters (1,083 ft) tall, about the same height 
        as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris.

        The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the
         first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m
        (906 ft) above the ground - the highest observation deck accessible
        to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to 
        ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb
        from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the 
        climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent 
        a 600-step climb. Although there is a staircase to the top level, 
        it is usually accessible only by lift.
