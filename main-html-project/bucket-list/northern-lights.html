        An aurora also commonly known as the polar lights is a natural 
        light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude 
        regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic 
        patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, 
        or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky. Auroras are the result 
        of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major 
        disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind 
        from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances 
        alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric 
        plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate 
        into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting 
        ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of 
        varying color and complexity.
