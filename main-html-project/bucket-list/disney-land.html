    <p> Tokyo Disneyland is a theme park at the Tokyo Disney Resort
        in Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, near Tokyo. It was the
        first Disney Park to be built outside the United States and
        it opened on April 15, 1983. The park was constructed by WED
        Enterprises in the same style as Magic Kingdom in Florida and
        Disneyland in California. It is owned by The Oriental Land 
        Company, which licenses intellectual property from The Walt
        Disney Company. Tokyo Disneyland and its companion park, Tokyo
        DisneySea, are the only Disney parks in the world not owned or
        operated by The Walt Disney Company in any capacity.
    </p>

    <p><b> The park has seven themed areas: </b></p>
    <ol>
        <li> World Bazaar </li>
        <li> Adventureland </li>
        <li> Westernland </li>
        <li> Fantasyland </li>
        <li> Tomorrowland </li>
        <li> Critter Country </li>
        <li> Toontown </li>
    </ol>

    <p> Many of these areas mirror those in the original Disneyland
        as they are based on American Disney films and fantasies. 
        Fantasyland includes Peter Pan's Flight, Snow White's Scary
        Adventures, and Dumbo the Flying Elephant, based on Disney 
        films and characters. The park is noted for its extensive 
        open spaces to accommodate the large crowds that visit the 
        park. As of 2019, Tokyo Disneyland is the most visited theme
        park in Japan and the third-most visited theme park in the 
        world behind Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World and Disneyland
        Park at the Disneyland Resort.
