        The ocean graces more than 70 percent of our planet, and 
        millions of marine species call these waters home. Whether 
        you are a novice or an experienced snorkeler, there are plenty 
        of places to witness enchanting underwater life. All you need 
        is a mask, snorkel, and fins to experience the beauty of coral 
        reefs and the intriguing creatures that thrive beneath the waves.
        Snorkeling includes both snorkel swimming and snorkel diving.  
        Snorkel swimming is snorkeling on the surface of the water.  
        Snorkel diving however, includes breath-hold diving and swimming 
        below the surface.
